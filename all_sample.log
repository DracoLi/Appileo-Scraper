Begin collecting data using our time efficient, research-based rubric containing only three domains, or customize the rubric the second after you download it. Our pre-made rubric comes complete with category and sub-category definitions and indicators. You don\u201at have to think twice about what to mark. The app guides each administrator in collecting consistent and valid data. All you have to do is check the box if you see or hear the category in the classroom. Want to add an indicator that describes your school? You can! You can add, delete, or revise all of the content in this app. Each observation is automatically saved with a time and date stamp. This app generates a variety of reports including a one that automatically aggregates the data to give you percentages of frequency. The percentages can then be used to analyze the data and identify school-wide trends. Reports are automatically updated when the rubric is customized and, as an added feature, you now have the ability to fully customize your reports! \n\nThe FOCUS app also features readily available statistics that can help assist administrators in implementing much needed professional development. Once you receive the results, share them with your staff! Teachers engage in their work in isolation, but planning is intended to be data-driven and collaborative. Bringing collaboratively obtained trend data to the center of the discussion spurs reflection about school-wide instructional practices and helps individual teachers make modifications to maximize student learning.

It is largely represents the Old Testament. This provides a great base of statistical modeling. Thus studying vocabulary based on such modeling is quite important. \n\nThis software uses a statistical vocabulary list. Initially you will start by studying the most frequently used words. As time goes on you will move on to progressively more difficult words. Studies have shown that some people will forget a word as much as 52 times before finally committing it to memory. \n\n\"A+ Hebrew Study Tool\" uses a unique statistical analysis method to measure your progress for each word. After some time the software knows which words you know and which words you do not know. It then focuses on trouble words until you know them. If on the other hand if you really know a word already, just tell the software to remove it from your study list. It is that simple. \n\nartificial emersion... \n\nAs a person who is fluent in two languages I can say without doubt the best way to study a foreign language is to use emersion. However, this is not always a possibility. By quizzing your brain regularly and repetitively, every day, you can fool your brain into feeling emersed. What better way to study than by using your cell phone. You carry it everywhere. You can make use of time otherwise waisted, by studying vocabulary. Your phone actually becomes an intelligent flash card system, helping you to remember! \n\nGood Luck and God bless.","updated_at":"2012-06-12T23:09:04Z","version":"1.1"},{"a_id":321085725.0,"advisory":"4+","bundle_id":"com.danielwong.interviewbrainpuzzles","created_at":"2012-06-12T23:09:04Z","devices":["iphone","ipad"],"game_center":false,"id":"4fd7cc10a636d4188b0001cb","lang":["EN"],"name":"A+ Interview Brain Puzzles","pics":{"created_at":"2012-06-12T23:09:04Z","icon100":"http://a2.mzstatic.com/us/r1000/018/Purple/6e/f6/0e/mzl.qzrkyiwn.jpg","icon512":"http://a2.mzstatic.com/us/r1000/018/Purple/6e/f6/0e/mzl.qzrkyiwn.jpg","icon60":"http://a4.mzstatic.com/us/r1000/021/Purple/56/21/c5/mzl.nklrynny.png","id":"4fd7cc10a636d4188b0001c8","ipad":[],"iphone":["http://a2.mzstatic.com/us/r1000/004/Purple/b6/bc/2d/mzl.wyfaojyq.png","http://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r1000/017/Purple/90/d3/91/mzl.ahfzxegk.png","http://a1.mzstatic.com/us/r1000/021/Purple/ad/68/0a/mzl.xagdiuip.png","http://a2.mzstatic.com/us/r1000/053/Purple/94/c2/b8/mzl.bnbwpuqs.png"],"updated_at":"2012-06-12T23:09:04Z"},"publisher":{"company":"Daniel Wong","created_at":"2012-06-12T23:09:04Z","id":"4fd7cc10a636d4188b0001c7","name":"Daniel Wong","p_id":307349779.0,"updated_at":"2012-06-12T23:09:04Z"},"size":324075,"store":[{"country":"us","created_at":"2012-06-12T23:09:04Z","current_average_rating":3.0,"current_ratings_count":15,"id":"4fd7cc10a636d4188b0001cc","link":"http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/a+-interview-brain-puzzles/id321085725?mt=8&uo=4","price":{"amount":1.99,"created_at":"2012-06-12T23:09:04Z","currency":"USD","id":"4fd7cc10a636d4188b0001c9","updated_at":"2012-06-12T23:09:04Z"},"publisher_link":"http://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/daniel-wong/id307349779?uo=4","rank":null,"release_date":"2009-07-06T01:09:03Z","review":[{"author":"Chanelguerrero","body":"Be advised, this application is not anything of a useful tool nor does it state and provide comprehensible information it reads to provide.","created_at":"2012-06-12T23:09:04Z","date":"2011-03-20","id":"4fd7cc10a636d4188b0001cd","rating":1,"subject":"Fraudulant description and wasteful non effective application scam.

This app is designed specifically for teachers to use to collect trend data.  Most current classroom walkthrough models are based upon the formal, one-person leadership paradigm, where the administrator is solely respon\u00acsible for collecting, evaluating and relaying data.  This dated model has proven to be not only unsustainable, but also highly ineffective.  The goal of iWalk is to provide a common, data-driven language for teacher-led, continuous improvement. Fully customizable to your school\u2019s specific needs, it allows teachers to work collaboratively toward achieving positive, school-wide change.  \n\nTeachers can begin collecting data using our time efficient, research-based rubric containing only three domains, or customize the rubric.  Our pre-made rubric comes complete with category and sub-category definitions and indicators.  You don\u2019t have to think twice about what to mark.  The app guides each teacher in collecting consistent and valid data.  All you have to do is check the box if you see or hear the category in the classroom.  Want to add an indicator that describes your school?  You can!  You can add, delete, or revise all of the content in this app.  This app generates four aggregated reports.  Being able to only view data as an aggregated report eliminates the ability to judge another teacher.  The percentages automatically aggregated in each report can be used to analyze the data and identify school-wide trends.  Reports are automatically updated when the rubric is customized and, as an added feature, you now have the ability to fully customize your reports!      \n\nThe iWalk app also features readily available statistics that will guide collaborative teacher discussions regarding needed professional development.

It is largely represents the New Testament.  This provides a great base of statistical modeling.  As you probably know, Metzger has published a list of words based on statistical usage models.  Unlike modern languages, where 2000 or more words must be memorized before you can hold basic conversations, much of the Greek New Testament can be read with a knowledge of as little as 1000 words.  Thus studying vocabulary based on such modeling is quite important.\n\nThis software uses Metzger's vocabulary list.  Initially you will start by studying the most frequently used words.  As time goes on you will move on to progressively more difficult words. \n\nStudies have shown that some people will forget a word as much as 52 times before finally committing it to memory.  \"A+ Koine Study Tool\" uses a unique statistical analysis method to measure your progress for each word.  After some time the software knows which words you know and which words you do not know.  It then focuses on trouble words until you know them.  If on the other hand if you really know a word already, just tell the software to remove it from your study list.  It is that simple.\n\nartificial emersion...\n\nAs a person who is fluent in two languages I can say without doubt the best way to study a foreign language is to use emersion.  However, in the case of Koine, this is not a possibility.  By quizzing you brain regularly and repetitively, every day, you can fool your brain into feeling emersed.   What better way to study than by using your cell phone.  You carry it everywhere.  You can make use of time otherwise waisted, by studying vocabulary.  Your phone actually becomes an intelligent flash card system, helping you to remember!\n\nGood Luck and God bless.","updated_at":"2012-06-12T23:09:04Z","version":"2.2"},{"a_id":319464018.0,"advisory":"4+","bundle_id":"matchmap-us","created_at":"2012-06-12T23:09:04Z","devices":["iphone","ipad"],"game_center":false,"id":"4fd7cc10a636d4188b00024a","lang":["EN"],"name":"A+ Matchmap (3 in 1)","pics":{"created_at":"2012-06-12T23:09:04Z","icon100":"http://a1.mzstatic.com/us/r1000/057/Purple/d8/09/48/mzl.qgcdfqce.png","icon512":"http://a1.mzstatic.com/us/r1000/057/Purple/d8/09/48/mzl.qgcdfqce.png","icon60":"http://a2.mzstatic.com/us/r1000/038/Purple/c1/cd/2a/mzl.iwhfgxzr.png","id":"4fd7cc10a636d4188b000247","ipad":[],"iphone":["http://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r1000/025/Purple/04/f2/1c/mzl.oogstvop.png","http://a2.mzstatic.com/us/r1000/029/Purple/57/07/c5/mzl.rqgngjql.png","http://a1.mzstatic.com/us/r1000/058/Purple/c3/c1/33/mzl.zlysapcn.png","http://a1.mzstatic.com/us/r1000/008/Purple/f9/9a/88/mzl.ybuguqht.png"],"updated_at":"2012-06-12T23:09:04Z"},"publisher":{"company":"Green Onion Software Co., Ltd.","created_at":"2012-06-12T23:09:04Z","id":"4fd7cc10a636d4188b000246","name":"Green Onion Software Co., Ltd.","p_id":301292274.0,"updated_at":"2012-06-12T23:09:04Z"},"size":3475199,"store":[{"country":"us","created_at":"2012-06-12T23:09:04Z","current_average_rating":3.5,"current_ratings_count":18,"id":"4fd7cc10a636d4188b00024b","link":"http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/a+-matchmap-3-in-1/id319464018?mt=8&uo=4","price":{"amount":0.99,"created_at":"2012-06-12T23:09:04Z","currency":"USD","id":"4fd7cc10a636d4188b000248","updated_at":"2012-06-12T23:09:04Z"},"publisher_link":"http://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/green-onion-software-co.-ltd./id301292274?uo=4","rank":null,"release_date":"2009-06-17T07:00:00Z","review":[{"author":"_MNH","body":"I've always been ashamed of my poor knowledge of African geography.

Memorizing words based on statistical usage models is what really matters.  \n\nStudies have shown that some people will forget a word as much as 52 times before finally committing it to memory.  \"A+ Spanish Study Tool\" uses a unique statistical analysis method to measure your progress for each word.  After some time the software knows which words you know and which words you do not know.  It then focuses on trouble words until you know them.  If on the other hand you ALREADY know a word, just tell the software to remove it from your study list.  It is that simple.\n\nartificial emersion...\n\nAs a person who is fluent in two languages I can say without doubt the best way to study a foreign is to use emersion.  However few people have the opportunity to move to another country.  By quizzing your brain regularly and repetitively, everyday, you can fool your brain into believing it is emersed.   What better way to study than by using your cell phone.  You carry it everywhere.  You can make use of time other wise waisted, by studying vocabulary.

The part 1 audio provides an easy-to-use study technique for retention and later retrieval of material. The part 2 audio is used while studying or working to reinforce the technique. If you can't study while listening to music, you might want to look for something else. Michael's voice is soothing, while his suggestions are clear and easy to adapt. The music is calming, yet doesn't put me to sleep or distract me. Honestly, I was surprised by how I seemed to just know \"the answers\" after using this technique.\" \n\n***** Helpful!  - Jessica Alvarez\n\"I found this program very helpful since my mind seems to wander a lot. It seems to be the perfect amount of time to study then take a break for a few minutes then return to studying. I've told several friends about it. Thanks!\"\n\nOne of the biggest obstacles for students of all ages is finding a way to study without being distracted. \n\nCan you remember a specific time when you were studying for an exam or writing an essay, and everything seemed to just be flowing perfectly? Maybe you were listening to music or you just were able to find yourself in that place where learning seemed easy and you were beginning to feel very motivated about the possibility of learning this subject... \n\nThen there are most of those other times where you can barely bring yourself to get your books out. Trust me, as a grad school student, I've been there too. What has helped me the most is a program that I designed for myself. I use a unique technique that I call \"The Whiteboard of My Mind\". This program totally helps me to get into a powerful state for learning. \n\nI'm actually on my third language now and I'm a busy person just like you. I think you realize the importance of your studies. After all, you are investing a lot of time and money into learning these subjects... So if you are going to do it at all, why not do it well? I'll bet you can accomplish more in just twenty minutes using the A+ Student program than you normally accomplish in an hour. \n\nWant to know why? Distractions... \n\nI know you know what I'm talking about - almost anything seems more exciting than studying. But, how would things be different if you could stay on track for a solid twenty minutes or more? How much more time would you have to do the things you want to do? How much better would your grades become? If your studies are important to you, then it makes sense to use the methods that will help you be the most productive, doesn't it? This program is very inexpensive and most students spend more money than this on just coffee in a day. So, make your time worthwhile and learn as much as you can because the world needs you - at your brightest! Be Amazing!\n\nThis app includes: \n\n- 8 minute NLP / self-hypnosis audio program with binaural beat frequencies \n\n- 3 20-minute audios with binaural beat frequencies for studying\n\n- 60 page e-book \"An Overview of NLP & Ericksonian Hypnosis\" \n\n- 7 minute video overview of the A+ Student program and considerations for effective study habits\n\nMichael J.

It's a five star Ap if I could get it to work. \n-------------------------------------\n\nI am loving the concept of this ap! LOVE the tally at the week's end and the fact that we can allocate percentages to savings/investing/spending...... Also think it's super cool that you can specify addition one-off chores for certain days in addition to the ones you choose from the pre-loaded list ( these repeat on each day once chosen from the list at start up ). So there are really really awesome things built it.... B U T how in the world do I edit this week's list? For instance I accidentally put \"gather trash from bathrooms\" on the wrong day. How do I remove it from Wednesday and put it on Tuesday? And how do I change the amount allocated for the preset chores once I'm adding additional chores?? Example: I want him to earn an average of .35 per day to total up to roughly 2.50 per week. If I have two chores one day and four chores the next day, how can I adjust the earnings, or what if one chore is especially labor intensive and I want to change the earned amount..... It seems that once you set up a day or a week, you can't get back in to make adjustments to the preset chores OR the added chores. PLEASE HELP!!!!! I love this ap and want to use it for sure, but now I'm stuck with this current week being loaded with wrong chores and incorrect amounts.
